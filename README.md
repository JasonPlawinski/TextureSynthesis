# TextureSynthesis

This repository contains numpy implementations of 4 texture synthesis algorithm. They both have a color and a grayscale implementation.
the algorithms are:
-Non-Parametric texture synthesis (1999) A.A Effros https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/790383
-Pyramid-Based Texture Analysis/Synthesis (1995) D.J Heeger http://www.cns.nyu.edu/heegerlab/content/publications/Heeger-siggraph95.pdf
-Image Quilting (2001) A.A Effros https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/papers/efros-siggraph01.pdf
-Random Phase Noise (2011) B. Galerne https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gousseau/random_phase.pdf

The code is not really commented but a run through of how everything works is countained in the powerpoint document.
A performance analysis of the diffenrent algorithm is also done (notebook/xls/powerpoint files) to balance out quality of results and computaion time (Non-parametric texture synthesis is really slow ZZZzzz)
