# TextureSynthesis

This repository contains numpy implementations of 4 texture synthesis algorithms. They both have a color and a grayscale implementation.
the algorithms are:<br />
-Non-Parametric texture synthesis (1999) A.A Effros https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/790383 <br />
-Pyramid-Based Texture Analysis/Synthesis (1995) D.J Heeger http://www.cns.nyu.edu/heegerlab/content/publications/Heeger-siggraph95.pdf<br />
-Image Quilting (2001) A.A Effros https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/papers/efros-siggraph01.pdf <br />
-Random Phase Noise (2011) B. Galerne https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gousseau/random_phase.pdf <br />

Codes are avialable in Grayscale and color. <br />
For each a type, there is a script containing all the implementations but with no comments. The comments are only available for each individual implementation. <br />
For additional information and general intuition of the synthesis works, please refer to the powerpoint file. <br />
A performance analysis of the diffenrent algorithm is also done (notebook/xls/powerpoint files) to balance out quality of results and computaion time (Non-parametric texture synthesis is really slow ZZZzzz)
